We do too! :)¬†Open-sourceWe are a team of veteran open-source developers, working on educational and community-based projects in an open-first environment ‚Äì and we are looking for new members. By joining us, you will work full-time on open-source, pushing your changes to free software projects upstream through pull requests, contributing features, documentation, or help on public forums.¬†We care deeply about contributing our work upstream. You will see the results of your work reused and recognized across the educational community, increasing access to quality education for everyone, everywhere.Remote-firstUnlike companies who reluctantly started to accept remote workers recently, we have embraced it from day 1. For the past 7 years, we have based and refined our way of working around remote-friendly workflows, from the ground up. No day-long video meetings, mandatory work hours, or risk of being forced back into an office one day -- as long as you have a good internet connection, it‚Äôs none of our business when or where you work from. :)We are all working remotely, from all continents (except Antarctica, at least so far - applicants welcome!). We use remote-friendly and timezone-agnostic workflows based on asynchronous principles and good documentation practices.Online educationWe are one of the main contributors to the Open edX project, the main open-source MOOC platform created by MIT, Harvard and many other top universities. It powers sites like edX.org, the MIT Open Learning Library, and the national online learning platform for France. We provide development and hosting for institutions like Harvard Medical School, Harvard LabXchange, Cloudera, Autodesk, and several governments. We are not affiliated with edX.org, but we contribute and work with them on various projects.¬†Technical stackThe Open edX project is a large Python/Django codebase, with good code standards and architecture. Tasks are varied, from developing core platform features, custom exercises and tools for specific courses (XBlocks), customizing and deploying instances, working full-stack, operating our service infrastructure, improving our hosting platform, etc. You won't get bored here.Contracting termsThis is a full-time, permanent contract position. We aim for long-term relationships -- once in, almost all team members stay for many years.¬†We care about paying fairly:¬†Team members set their own compensation level, which is paid based on hours worked (no unpaid overtime!).¬†When determining your rate, we will expect you to factor in benefits (vacation, healthcare, purchase budgets, etc.) - the idea is to let you pick the benefits that are useful to you, rather than offer one-size-fits-all packages that aren‚Äôt always very valuable.We also proactively apply generous raises team-wide, based on the company results at the end of each year. See the details about how we approach compensation in our handbook.We also firmly believe in work-life balance: as long as you deliver what you commit to, there is a lot of latitude in how much work you can choose to accept. We are open to time commitments anywhere in the 30h to 40h/week range, and highly discourage working more than that. It‚Äôs important to have time to ourselves, as well as having some slack, and there are diminishing returns in working more anyway. We are currently recruiting precisely to preserve that balance, and ensure we have plenty of capacity to handle our projects.We welcome applicants of all genders and ethnicities.Basic Requirements:Experience with contributing to free software projects - small contributions are completely fine, but you must have at least one patch or pull request merged in a third-party project, or been a maintainer of an open source project with significant adoption. (Note that you can contribute now to satisfy this requirement - see for example the Open edX release issues, fixing one of these issues guarantees an interview.)Senior developer with 3+ years working with PythonExperience with Python web frameworks, specifically Django3+ years of HTML, Javascript, and CSS (experience with React and/or Typescript is a big plus!)Experience with unit testingComfortable working in a Linux environment, specifically Debian or UbuntuExperience with databases: MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQLAdditional Skills:You will work on tasks from the following categories, but you can pick up the skills on the job if you haven't mastered these yet:DevOps experience, especially on Debian/Ubuntu servers, Terraform, Vault, Packer, Prometheus, ELK, Docker. We are building a modern infrastructure and having a strong DevOps presence on top of core software engineering skills is a big plus with us.Cloud computing, like AWS or OpenStackConfiguration management tools such as Ansible, ConsulRabbitMQ, Redis & ElasticsearchMobile development (iOS and/or Android)Managing clients & projects from beginning to completion (senior developer)Public speaking at conferences (you would present a talk every year at the Open edX Con)Apply for this PositionOur recruitment process differs from most other companies - we don‚Äôt believe resumes and the traditional interviews to be particularly effective. Often, they tell more about how good someone is at interviewing, rather than at the actual work. So, our initial interview is lighter and easier to pass than in other companies - but we then provide you with real (and paid!) work to see how it works out in reality.Step 1: You apply by filling out this form: https://opencraft.com/jobs/open-source-developer/¬†Step 2: We do two interviews with candidates matching the requirements listed above. The first interview includes a (simple) coding exercise.Step 3: If this works out, we hire you! We start with a 2 months trial period, which allows both you and the rest of the team to fully evaluate how we work together, and is followed by a final review and confirmation.¬† Apply for this position  Share this job:  Help us maintain the quality of jobs posted on We Work Remotely.

As stated above, we make remote working possible by embracing our ethos, yet many teams also travel to meet in person every 1-2 months.

A¬∑Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A¬∑Teamers earn $11.4+ million since.As part of A¬∑Team, you can expect:High-paying, meaningful missions with the most audacious companies sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters. We're picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. We've worked with Lyft, McGraw Hill, ClearCo, irl.com, the former CEO of Waze, the leading vaccine production software, several new unicorns we can't say here, and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc.Work alongside friends old & new: our niche is small/diverse product teams, since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams, not individuals. Of course, we keep friends together whenever we can.Full autonomy: say ""no"" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A¬∑Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too.¬†Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings: for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term, we're creating micro-communities for the world's top builders to become friends around the things they care about.Keep 100% of what you earn: if you charge $130/hr, you get $130/hr. A¬∑Team makes money by charging a small, flat, transparent platform fee on top of your rate.How to apply:Go here: https://build.a.team/wwrfastrackreferral + mention WWR under how you heard about A¬∑Team. No resume or cover letter needed; we respect your time so the application is short. We're also much more interested in seeing what you've made, and excited to chat more if there‚Äôs a fit.What you‚Äôll do:Once part of A.Team, you‚Äôll regularly be invited to impactful missions that match your interests, which you can accept or decline. Take your pick from early-stage incubations with world-class founders, to fast-growing super-funded companies, to old school non-tech incumbents looking to build as a tech giant would.Missions usually involve building an ambitious piece of software from 0 to 1 as part of a small 3-4 person team.¬†You‚Äôll be paid to scope it out, give the client options, guide strategy, and execute on the selected solution. Sometimes the client has a clear vision, sometimes not; which is why A.Team builders tend to be senior folks who can work together to find the right direction.¬†Who A¬∑Team is for:Senior software developers who left large companies and high-growth startups to pursue their craft with autonomy.Those who prefer consistent contract work over a full-time role, who want to create a variety of new products alongside other top-tier builders.The majority of A.Teamers spend most of their time doing independent work, but a sizeable percentage are either employed full-time (but testing out client work), bootstrapping a side project, or looking for their next big thing.Who A¬∑Team is not for:People looking for small gigs.Folks looking to build simple wordpress/wix/squarespace-style websites.Those still early in their careers and recent university/bootcamp grads (at least not yet).Our long-term vision:A¬∑Team is a new type of company for a new kind of independent software builders. We call them ""unhirables"": people who traditional companies couldn‚Äôt hire full-time even if they wanted to, but who want to do their most meaningful work with their favorite people in small, autonomous, distributed expert teams.¬†To help us secure amazing missions, we raised $5 million+ (not public, yet) from NFX, Village Global, and Box Group, along with the former CEO of Upwork, the founders of Fiverr and Lemonade, Apple's Global Head of Recruiting, YC Partner Aaron Harris, Wharton's Adam Grant, and Duke's Dan Ariely.

You‚Äôll work with us to architect, build, deploy, and maintain applications used by the world‚Äôs largest record companies (and some of the world‚Äôs smallest). This is a full-time position that can be in our office (Los Angeles/Santa Monica) or fully remote (US only at this time). We are looking for engineers with two or more years of full stack web application development experience. Starting salary range is 100-150k depending on experience. Learn more about OpenPlay at: www.openplay.coEngineering at OpenPlayThousands of record labels around the world use our flagship product OpenPlay Music to manage and distribute their music. We work with the major US record distributors and many independents. We are onboarding another 300+ record labels this year and we need to grow our engineering team to handle increasing demand for both client services and new product growth. OpenPlay is a bootstrapped, growing company started in 2013.In your role at OpenPlay you will be collaborating with a team of 4-6 other engineers and a UX/visual designer to design, build, review, deploy, maintain, and iterate on OpenPlay‚Äôs web applications. We follow a minimal agile process focused on rapid deployment and incremental improvement. Engineers participate in a weekly planning meeting, a daily engineering meeting, choose what to work on, and then spend the rest of their time getting their work done, collaborating as needed.You will share the same responsibilities as the rest of your engineering team, which include:Participating in a weekly planning meeting where we review our goals and prioritize work to be done for the coming week.Participating in daily engineering-only meetings (roughly 30min) where the team collaborates on technical decisions, resolving issues, and reducing complexity.Writing tests: we write mostly full-stack integration tests and use a single testing framework for all parts of the code.Writing application code: mostly Ruby, some HTML, some Javascript. CSS is mostly handled by visual design.Reviewing code: We do round-robin code reviews as a means of knowledge sharing. All pull requests are reviewed by another engineer. You‚Äôll take turns reviewing everyone else‚Äôs code and they will take turns reviewing yours.Deploying code: We deploy small changes to production code multiple times per day. Deployments are automated with lots of fail-safes and we rely on third party services for devops as much as possible.Maintaining code: Maintenance is a part of all code changes but we also plan specifically for improving code quality and updating to newer conventions, techniques, and technologies. You will also be reproducing and fixing the occasional bug.Some things you won‚Äôt do:Estimating work to be done. Instead we try to break work down into small enough chunks that they can be done quickly.Reporting progress. Work is done when it‚Äôs deployed. Instead we try to reduce the scope of work that is growing complex.Stakeholder meetings. While agile processes are all about open channels of communication we find too much can be overwhelming. We have technical product managers who work with stakeholders instead, allowing everyone else to focus on their work while getting their questions answered.As a small company with a flat management structure there are lots of opportunities for everyone to make an impact not only on our products but also on how we build them. We apply the same methodology of incremental improvement to our code as we do to our tools, processes, and conventions. You will be able to participate in these discussions as much as you like, and we would like to learn from your experience, but the degree to which you participate is up to you.Experience we‚Äôre looking forThe main thing we‚Äôre looking for is experience in full stack web application development. Specifically, we think you‚Äôll need at least two years experience working on all parts of a database-centric web application to be a productive member of your team. In particular you should have experience with:Relational database concepts such as: foreign keys, indexes, normalization and denormalization, SQL queries.Writing Ruby code in an MVC web framework. We don‚Äôt use Rails but we follow many of the same conventions. We‚Äôve had success bringing people on from Python/Django so if you have Python experience and would like to learn Ruby it might be a good fit.Some familiarity with Javascript. We push as much behavior as possible to the server but features often do have small client-side components.Writing tests. We practice integration-test-heavy outside-in test-driven development. If you‚Äôve practiced any sort of test-driven development you will pick it up fast.In addition to being able to get things done we are also looking for someone who can research and implement best practices in order to get things done well. Code smells and poor architectural decisions can slow everyone down and make everyone sad. We collaborate frequently and we don‚Äôt always get things right on the first try, but we are looking for people who will do the work to build things well to reduce the maintenance burden for themselves and their team.Technologies we useOpenPlay Music is a monolithic application backed by a PostgreSQL relational database. Heavy operations are processed asynchronously by scalable background workers that notify clients via WebSockets. At present we have plenty of room to scale.Our server-side code is MVC-structured and built on Sequel (ORM), Sinatra, and HAML. If you‚Äôre familiar with Rails (or similar MVC frameworks) you‚Äôll find a lot of similarities and many of the same conventions here.On the client side we use StimulusJS to apply bits of dynamic behavior where it improves the user experience, most of which ultimately requests updates from the server.There are currently around 2500 full-stack browser-based integration tests covering every feature from user input to expected output. CI runs on every git push and completes in about 15 minutes.We do things typical of web applications like:Store data in, and query from, a relational database (PostgreSQL)Index data and query it with filtering and full text searching (Elasticsearch)Handle slow tasks with background processingPush asynchronous updates to clients with WebSocketsExport XML files, PDFs, CSVs, Excel spreadsheets, and other formats that just won‚Äôt seem to go awayImport data from Excel spreadsheets, (music-industry standard) DDEX XML, JSON, and various other sourcesCommunicate with lots of external systems across all manner of bespoke APIsProvide JSON APIs for our customers to build on top ofUse git for version control, build features in branches, and take turns reviewing pull requestsRun everything on cloud infrastructureRely on service providers for devops as much as possible (Heroku, etc)Some benefits of working at OpenPlayStarting salary 100-155k depending on experienceMedical, dental, and vision insuranceWhatever tools, services, books, etc you need to do your jobLow stress environment: The industry we‚Äôre in is comparatively low scale and high value. While we work with lots of data we avoid some of the technical issues and constant urgency you might find with consumer applications.Good work/life balance: We expect that everyone works full time (40 hours/week). We do sometimes have deadlines and we haven‚Äôt always limited scope appropriately. The last time we worked late nights was in 2019 for about a week. The time before that was in 2016 for about 3 weeks. Our most recent deadline we met two weeks early.Flexible work and vacation schedule. You are free to work the hours that work best for you (outside of our scheduled meetings) and we don‚Äôt have a set limit on vacation days.Free to work remote. We‚Äôve been doing remote work as long as we‚Äôve been around and our process is built around it. Some of our team is permanently remote, others work out of the office part time.Office near the beach in Santa Monica you can use any time.Free lunch at nearby restaurants when you‚Äôre in the office. Some of which are delicious.How to applySend us your resume! Include a cover letter to add additional details and context if you feel so inclined. We‚Äôre mostly looking for two things:Prior work experience that looks like it might be a good match for what you‚Äôll be doing at OpenPlay.Some understanding of how to program well. Maybe a computer science degree or other academic background. Code contributions you can point to. Blog articles you wrote. A particularly enlightening reddit comment.We‚Äôd love to know a bit about you as well but it can be a challenging prospect for an initial job application. Feel free to include anything else you‚Äôd like, but don‚Äôt worry too much about it, we‚Äôre mostly looking for the above qualifications at this point.We look forward to hearing from you, good luck on your job search wherever it leads, and thank¬† you for considering joining OpenPlay!

But there are a lot of reasons for you to jump at this opportunity.Let me explain.We help small businesses compete with large corporations for exposure online. Normally the giants have a huge advantage, but we level the playing field.We do this by publishing content about our clients on some of the biggest sites online.¬†We've been incredibly successful at this. More and more companies want to work with us so we need to publish more and more content.And that's why we need your help! You'll be writing our clients' company announcements and describing their products.But what's in it for you? Why would you want to write for us?4 Main Reasons To Start Writing For Us1. Awesome Side IncomeI don't have to tell you that great side income opportunities don't come around that often. But this is one of them.Most of our writers earn between $800-$2000/month working part-time. Working at a moderate pace, that's over $18/h. And some of our writers are able to make as much as $30/h.2. Flexibility You've Been Looking ForWe don't have any expectations for the amount of work you'll do. It's 100% up to you. This is perfect if you need extra income but have other things going on besides this job.And you can do the job at any time that's convenient for you. Set your own hours and work at your own pace.3. Stability You Can Count OnOne of the worst things about writing jobs is that you always have to hustle to get new clients. This won't be the case with us. There will always be more work available if you want it.Our writers love that. No wonder they stay with us for years.4. Get The Training You NeedWe do expect your English to be bullet-proof. And you'll need some writing chops to get this job. But outside of that, we'll provide all the training that you need.Not only will you earn an excellent income, but you'll also get marketable skills that you'll use throughout your life.Here's What We Expect From YouYou are able to write in an easy-to-understand, smooth-flowing style.Your writing doesn't have spelling or grammatical errors.You always meet the deadlines you commit to.You are willing to work with editors and receive constructive feedback on your work, especially in the early stages.You are able to adjust your writing style between casual and more formal.You are ready to be part of a welcoming, supportive team of fellow writers.Experience writing press releases or online content is helpful but it‚Äôs not essential¬†How To ApplyFill out the application form on this page.It is critical that you use the word ‚Äúbanana‚Äù in the ‚ÄúWhy are you applying for this job‚Äù section.

In this role, you are trusted to know what you are doing and will only be asked to check in against KPI (key performance Indicators) to ensure you are on track.As a small company, there‚Äôs a lot of variety‚Äîbut also a range of recurring tasks that you can predict each day, week, and month. In a typical week, you might:Conduct site audits, keyword research, technical website analysis (through an SEO lens), content briefs and strategies, and more.Provide SEO strategy, addressing technical issues for websites with 15-1,000 pages.Present audits and other SEO work to other SEOs, senior management, and more, both externally and internally.Make an upsell if the opportunity arises and feel confident doing so.Be on the front lines when a client has a question, concern, or complaint.When required, complete basic on-site optimizations on popular CMSs.Differentiate between a quality link and a low-quality link.Complete a link audit, and provide recommendations to recover from penalty or otherwise.Provide training and mentorship to 1 or more other SEOs.Provide daily updates (3√ó3) to team members in Slack.¬†This position favors the unique individual that is both able to be a focused workhorse and, on a dime, be a boisterous social butterfly.

We do this by individually packaging up pieces of the SEO process and making them available at agency-friendly pricing in our dashboard. If all you need is content, we can do that. Links, we can do that too. It‚Äôs a la carte unless additional support is required, wherein we would take on the strategy, management, and fulfillment.

Identify the best SEO article opportunities using a leading SEO marketing tool (i.e. SEMRush, SurferSEO etc)2. Use contentatscale.ai (or a similar tool) to turn those opportunities into long form (2000-3000+ word) articles. These will be the ‚Äòfoundations‚Äô of each article.¬†3. Once the initial article is *created* (which is as simple as telling the AI tool what to write), the next step will be to give it a significant ‚Äòpolish‚Äô, taking great care to add in your unique voice and personality.¬†4. From there, we‚Äôll want to add unique images, which will include stock images + custom made images that you will assign to our team of graphic designers (they‚Äôre extremely talented and can even create high-level infographics!)5. (optional) Then, to make these articles even MORE unique, you want to add in relevant links and citations (to add more value to the article).¬†6. (optional) Source quotes from top real estate professionals (ideally from those who either specialize or have created similar content to what our article, which we‚Äôll offer backlinks in exchange for)¬†7. (optional) Find and include actual live examples of whatever is being talked about in the article, and add those to the article8. Help us work out a system to be able to share these articles to our primary social media platforms and encourage interactions / discussion with our client base---What was described above is *roughly* what we‚Äôre thinking the flow will look like.¬†AI content creation is still relatively new, and we expect to gather your insights and work with you to fine-tune whatever system helps us to best achieve our stated goals (create the best, most unique real estate content in our industry!).¬†Hourly Wage:$20-$35+ per hour, commensurate with experience and qualifications.¬†Working Hours:We expect a standard 40 hour work week, although you‚Äôre free to work as many more hours as you‚Äôd like!¬†Location:This is a 100% remote position, and while we welcome applications from anywhere in the world, we do expect your working hours to have at least 3-4 hours of overlap with standard USA time-zones so that we‚Äôre able to communicate without big delays.¬†Experience Requirements:- 3+ years proven experience as a content writer, preferably in the realm of SEO-driven content creation.- Proficient with leading SEO tools (e.g. SEMRush, SurferSEO)- Proficient in Google Analytics- Proficient in using AI to assist/augment in the creation of high-quality articles.¬†- Strong writing and editing skills, with the ability to maintain a consistent brand voice.- Excellent research skills to find relevant quotes, examples, and supporting materials.- Attention to detail and ability to meet tight deadlines without compromising quality.- Knowledge of social media platforms and strategies for maximizing content reach and engagement.- Experience in the real estate industry (preferred but not required).---If you think you possess all of these qualities, then we‚Äôd love to hear from you!!To Apply:If you think you‚Äôre a good fit, then please fill out our application here: https://form.typeform.com/to/K5f29u7N Apply for this position  Share this job:  Help us maintain the quality of jobs posted on We Work Remotely.

We have good systems, good processes and a great product. But we need someone to come in and breathe new life and energy into what we're doing. And to lead us to our goal of 100 new clients per month. That is why finding the right fit for this role is the company's TOP priority.We believe that humans are underrated, that we are created in the image of God. And when we turn our ideas into legit products that help people, the world is a better place and the kingdom expands. That's why our mission is making it nearly impossible to fail for our clients to get customers.This allows our clients to have more impact, make really cool stuff, and not have to spend every waking hour worrying about revenue.We've been in coaching and training for 10 years. Along the way, we've done a lot of fun and creative projects that any marketing geek will have their heart warmed by:Examples:1. 24-Hour Product Challenges: Where we built a product from scratch in 24 hours and sold it, all while live streaming the entire process.2. Tool Partnerships: We built entire SaaS products from scratch in order to land marketing partnerships with large companies in our industry.If you geek out on this kind of testing and creativity in marketing, keep reading!This role is important because without you we will not have the ability to continue expanding our training programs and tools. We need you to step into the marketing machine we have and make it better. Improve our approach, build upon what we've started, invent new and better techniques. And, most of all, have fun helping people turn their ideas into thriving businesses and then work with those businesses to grow them.Interested? Keep reading. What you will do in this role?As the Director of Marketing for Growth Tools you will own and rebuild our marketing department from the ground up. There are several aspects to that, but the most important is lead generation for our phone sales team. Meaning, you're more immediate item is booking 150+ appointments for our phone sales team each week via email marketing and paid ads. You'll have 3 core areas and own 1 primary number.The core areas you'll be focused on are below and in priority order: Core Area #1. Building The Marketing Team Outcome: Your team is close knit, enthusiastic, and has momentum and maniacal focus around the marketing department's goals. And those goals are clearly and simply aligned to the company's overall mission and targets. (25% of your time)Core Area #2. Marketing Strategy Outcome: You lead the marketing strategy for the company, always looking for large changes and small tweaks to improve things. Total marketing geek. (25% of your time) Core Area #23: OperationsOutcome: You are a hardcore operator at heart that loves being in the weeds, writing marketing copy, crafting campaigns, and tracking and learning from the data so your team can make adjustments along the way. You don't get in your team's way, you empower them. But you love working side by side with them (50% of your time). Your #1 goal is new clients.""# of new clients per month"" will be your north star and primary measure of how well you are doing in this role. The number that you are in charge is ""# of new clients per month"" aka: sales. And your 2 primary KPIs will be:1. Booking 150+ sales calls booked per week 2. <$1,500 cost to acquire a clientAs the leader of the company, my commitment to you is to always make sure you know what winning looks like and where you stand at all times. This is a performance marketing role. So, if you LOVE the idea of being praised, paid and promoted due to your team's top notch production, you'll love it here! But if you like squishy marketing that focused on social media, branding and other extremely squishy marketing practices that don't actually drive revenue - you'll hate it here. What will you learn in this role?If you come from the traditional offline marketing world or a standard marketing agency, our pace of innovation, action taking, and iteration might be uncomfortable for you. You'll learn how to move fast, iterate quickly, and put zero value into sunk cost. You'll also get to finally spread your wings, get rid of the red tape and do your thing.If you come from a large corporation or have a bloated management structure where you are now, this will feel like the first day out of prison after a 10-year stint.If you come from the start-up world or are a Founder yourself, this will feel like a dream in which you can just focus on building the marketing team and engine you've always wanted.If you are in marketing but have never taken on a Director role, this could be the opportunity you've been looking for. While we would love to have someone that's already ""done it,"". We're open to giving the perfect fit the opportunity.However, if you prefer highly defined day-to-day duties, don't really enjoy figuring things out, and trying new processes seems intimidating, you won't do well in this role.There is 0 red tape at Growth Tools. We don't care about how other people have always done things, how you have always done things, or what anyone's SOP is. What we care about is: 1) you love what you do every day and wake up excited to do it; and 2) our clients' success.We ruthlessly measure both on a daily basis.In this role you will be in charge of:1. Getting 100s of qualified prospects on the phone with our sales team2. Building out a simple yet robust marketing system 3. Hiring and empowering the best group of marketers you've ever seen4. Turn Growth Tools into a household name known by every online coach5. Drastically accelerate our pace to mission by breaking every sales goal you set You'll walk away from your time at Growth Tools having built an amazing world-class marketing team or people that you love being with, call friends but also know how to get crap done and drive revenue. This role will have been a success if you say: ""That was the best team I've ever been a part of and the product we created is a high watermark of my career!""Who will you work with?You will work directly with Will Deshazo, our Director of Sales and Bryan Harris our CEO and founder. We are a different kind of company. Our team is close knit, collaborative, competitive, and we maniacally give shout outs when we catch each other doing good things! (We even deliver cakes weekly to celebrate, too.)It's possible to do work you love!Where will you work?We work remote and have for 10 years! We all work remotely and are scattered around North America from Vancouver to Cleveland, and Nashville to Birmingham. That means you have the flexibility to work from home or a coworking location.What does Growth Tools do and why?Growth Tools provides the tools and training to help online businesses once and for all solve the problem of getting more clients. We work primarily with teaching based businesses (course creators, influencers, coaches, etc.) to help them significantly grow their revenue and impact‚Äîincluding getting them on the INC. 5000 list. Our tools consist of 10 SaaS products that we give away for free. Our training consists of a 1:1 coaching business, Growth University.We believe that humans are underrated and that we drastically underestimate what we're capable of. While much of the news and social media is focused on the negative, we have seen firsthand what a hope-filled entrepreneur is capable of and how much good they can do! At Growth Tools, our job is to help every client grow their business so more people can be helped and more good is done.Example:One of our clients, Chaitra Rahhakrishna, runs a small design studio. She works with e-commerce companies and helps them create beautiful websites that showcase and sell their products.When we first started working with her, she had $0 revenue and had just given birth to her first child. 12 months later, while being an awesome mom, she also grew her studio to $100,000. This totally changed her life, gave her freedom to be creative, and truly pour out her best work to her clients.Do you want to be on the front lines and directly involved with growing some of the coolest and more innovative companies in the world?I look forward to talking to you.PS: Here are 8 quick tips on how to stand out and get hired for this role.RequirementsYou have 3+ years experiencing scheduling 150+ appointments per week for a phone sales team via email marketing and paid ads. You have 3+ years leading a direct response marketing teamYou have 3+ years directly owning the revenue, leading KPIs and key marketing and revenue targetsYou eat, breathe and sleep direct response marketingYou have directly owned filling calendars for a phone sales teamYou are a high-bandwidth person capable of handling a dozen projects at a time while prioritizing and executing on the most important onesYou are really good with people and are energized by being around themDeep in your heart you want to be on a team of people that challenges each other, works tightly together and feels like family.

Our users include names like MrBeast‚Äôs snacking brand Feastables, Liquid Death, and Colgate.You can read about our app on the Shopify app store. We provide real-time reporting to ecommerce shop owners. To give you a sense of scale - we collect data on millions of orders per day from thousands of ecommerce stores and process many millions of background jobs to be able to deliver quality reporting and insights to our customers.We're looking to add a great backend RoR developer to our existing team.We are looking for someone who:has worked on and had to support a web app in production at scale for at least 5 yearsAt least 5 years of working experience writing maintainable and well-tested Ruby on Rails appshumble, can mentor others, both provide and receive direction and is always willing to share what they learnoverlaps with CET zone at least 5 hours ( prefer Europe )What you will do:extend the product to integrate with new ecommerce platforms (like Amazon)build and have ownership over new integrations with external data sources we use to augment our reports (we integrate with wide range of systems from ad platforms to CRMs and shipping services.)optimize our existing complex backend processing jobsoptimize existing data pipelinesparticipate in building new app features for thousands of merchants who trust us with their reporting dataWhere we are and how we work:We are a distributed team all over the globe but our development team is mainly working during Western European working hours.We are used to async communication over Slack but also have regular weekly meetings to sync up.Our tech stack is Ruby / Javascript / Stimulus / Tailwind CSS / SQL / GitWe optimize new features for the long term. For us, this is not a sprint but a marathon.Working for Lifetimely doesn't feel like the usual office or startup gig: we are a distributed group of twelve people across eight different countries with our own way of working.

Supporting such a significant number of integrations is a large undertaking and will require the ability to implement new systems in order to maintain the quality our users expect.At first, this will be a completely technical role where you work closely with Lucas and Mitchell (CoinLedger‚Äôs two technical co-founders) to get familiarized with the system, understand our processes, and take over development for net new and existing integrations. Your goal here is to become an expert with our current approach to building integrations and become a vacuum for new data across crypto platforms that CoinLedger does not yet support.Once this ramp-up phase is complete, your role will transition to a split of managerial work and technical work. You will work alongside the co-founders to bring on a team of 3-4 other developers and help them ramp up with the knowledge you have gained.

What a joy these days :-) Skynova (https://www.skynova.com) provides online invoicing, accounting and 30+ other business modules to self-employed and small businesses. Our main focus is the US, but we have customers from around 100 countries. Our customers are very happy: The service is easy to use and they get a good selection of tools that they can combine to fit their specific needs - all at a very competitive price point.¬†We were founded more than 10 years ago, but we think this is just the beginning! We have a long list of new modules to create, modules to improve, core systems to refactor, experiments to run, data crunching and page loads to speed up and more. The more we work on this, the more we think of - and our customers have some ideas as well :-)¬†To step up our efforts, we are now looking for Tech Lead to work on all of the above! This is a fully remote position, so autonomy and independence would be required. We collaborate using git, jira, e-mail, google meet and more. In addition you‚Äôll be invited to occasional meet-ups at the office in Oslo, Norway.There are in total 14 people working here, four in the US and ten in Europe.As a Tech Lead you‚Äôll be working directly with the CEO/founder (who has served as tech lead so far) as well as your technical team and others in the company - depending on what needs to be done.¬†Our stack is the LAMP stack; we use MVC and are moving towards a modular monolith. We don‚Äôt use micro-services, Kubernetes or complex cloud offerings. We try to keep things as simple and stable as possible. Boring tech has fewer bugs and requires less maintenance which also equals happy developers.Your personal desire should be to strive for simplicity. The code base is structured to make it easy to understand and simple to troubleshoot. We aim for code readability, even if this sometimes means more verbose code. We don‚Äôt code abstract functions trying to anticipate future needs we don‚Äôt yet know anything about. Usually we are wrong about what the future holds, and those abstractions make it harder to adapt the code. Coding to solve concrete well-known problems simplifies things both now and in the future. Our code architecture is sort of inspired by DDD. Each module is loosely coupled and isolated.¬†Here is an example of what this might mean in a daily life:¬†You need to code something that should cover the needs of 15 scenarios. After a week of intense thinking you come up with a single nice function following all best practices that handles it all. It will most likely be utterly incomprehensible to anyone but you, and you won‚Äôt understand it yourself after 6 months. When a bug surfaces in one of the 15 areas and you fix it, you end up breaking three of the other scenarios because consequences are hard to predict and see. What about the automated tests? It passes those with flying colors because the bugs are new. Instead your natural inclination and instinct should be to create 15 different functions with a good deal of overlap (by violating DRY). It is easier to code since you just handle one situation at a time, but a bit tedious. Others understand it, and when something breaks three years down the road, a fix only affects the intended area. Code review is much easier.¬†You will discuss such things with the CEO/founder and part of the role is to protect and promote this architecture - and over time help bring it to the next level.¬†You are a responsible person with a keen eye for details. When you say a ticket is ready for deployment, it means it is ready for deployment. You‚Äôll ensure that the code has been properly reviewed and that it has been tested. You‚Äôll need to test critical aspects yourself even if QA says it is ok, and it passed automated tests. The CEO will deploy the ticket to production.¬†Main responsibilities:Lead a team of six (backend, frontend, QA).¬†Code review (provide feedback to make the pull requests simpler and more readable; enforce standards and our code architecture)Mentor team membersWork on architectureSome coding¬†Provide architecture suggestions when new modules are to be coded or existing ones refactoredRequirements:10+ years as a developer¬†Experience with web/saas applicationsExperience as Tech Lead and / or ArchitectExcellent communication skillsExcellent English skillsExcellent writing skillsMaster / Ph.D. (Computer Science, Math, Physics, etc.)We offer:Stable, long-term contractFully remote (with occasional meet-ups)Interesting, diverse projectsHigh degree of independence and impactCompetitive wage: EUR 66 / USD 73 per hourIf you have any questions, feel free to ask about anything you want.
