# Job Searcher

Job Searcher is a Python application designed to fetch job postings from [WeWorkRemotely](https://weworkremotely.com), store them in a Neo4j graph database, and expose the data via GraphQL API endpoints. 

## Features
* Fetch job postings from WeWorkRemotely
* Store job and company data in a Neo4j database
* Expose data via GraphQL API endpoints
* Full Python-based implementation

## Setup & Installation

### Requirements

* Python 3.8 or higher
* Neo4j 4.x
* An active internet connection to fetch job data

### Steps

1. Clone this repository
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/jobsearcher.git
    cd jobsearcher
    ```

2. Install the required Python dependencies
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Start your Neo4j instance and ensure it's running correctly

4. Update the `config.py` file with your Neo4j credentials and database details.

5. Run the application
    ```
    python main.py
    ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, it fetches job data from WeWorkRemotely and stores it in the connected Neo4j database. 

The application provides GraphQL API endpoints to interact with the data. You can access these at `http://localhost:8000/graphql`.

Example GraphQL Query:

```graphql
{
  jobs {
    id
    name
    description
    url
    additional_info
    company {
      id
      name
      location
      website
      size
      established
      years_remote
    }
  }
}
```

This query returns all job postings along with their associated company details.
